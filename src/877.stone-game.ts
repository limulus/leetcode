// @lc code=start

/**
 * The stone game — with the constraints of the total number of stones being odd and the
 * number of piles being even — appears to be a “solved” game. Player 1 can ensure a win
 * by always choosing the pile that results in player 2 having to choose between the
 * lesser piles. This means we should be able to simply always return true.
 *
 * In the real world of course, we’d validate these constraints.
